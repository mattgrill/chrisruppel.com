  comment: The first photo of Karin and me! After they showed us around town we went out for drinks at Schlappen.

summary: Freiburg was my first stop after DrupalCon Munich. Little did I know it would be the best stop on my trip through Europe! This day was the catalyst for my moving to Europe to be with Karin.
