  comment: One of my favorite pictures of the trip. It captures the table cloth so well!
- caption: Lion's Head was quite easy-going compared to India Venster, but it was no less beautiful.

summary: Lion's Head is an easy hike for people of all skill levels. We easily made the top in about an hour, and we heard it's a good spot for night hiking too.
