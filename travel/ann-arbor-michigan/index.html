  <aside class="summary">We visited Jordan and Annette in Ann Arbor, Michigan. We had a fun week of hiking, canoeing, and furniture-building.</aside>

  <div class="story">
    <p>We visited our long-time friends Jordan and Annette at their new house in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Eric flew in from San Francisco too. We stayed for a week, just catching up.</p>

<p>They live near the Argo Canoe Livery along the Huron river and we went out on the water twice. The first time, Karin and I went with stand-up paddleboards while Jordan, Eric, and Annette went canoeing. The sun was hot but there were a few bridges offering some shade where we could take a break.</p>

<p>The second time was after Eric had taken off, so Jordan and Annette took their pup Bama as a passenger while Karin and I rowed our own canoe.</p>

<p>We both agreed it&rsquo;s a little more work to row a canoe; with paddleboards you&rsquo;re the captain of a one-person vessel, but with a canoe there&rsquo;s teamwork involved. We&rsquo;ll have to try a few more times to find our rhythm, which I presume you have to find for each new partner you try canoeing with.</p>

<p>We also went hiking and geocaching in the nearby parks (Barton Nature Area and Bird Hill Nature Area). We were bummed that we didn&rsquo;t find any of the geocaches we hunted for, but it was still fun to try and find them.</p>

<p>We went to a few really great restaurants, but my favorite was <strong>Frita Batidos</strong>, serving cuban-inspired street food. The main attractions are chorizo hamburgers served with fried egg and shoestring fries on top, and shakes made of tropical fruits like coconut and mango (enhanced by a splash of dark rum, of course).</p>

<p>Karin wanted to visit an arcade while in the States, and we found <strong>Pinball Pete&rsquo;s</strong> to be the perfect mix of old and new. We played some classics like Pac-Man and Centipede and ended up winning some sweet prizes after playing Skee-ball and other ticket games. Karin walked away with a bouncy ball and a finger trap!</p>
